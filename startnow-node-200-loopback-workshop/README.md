# Loopback Workshop

This project familiarizes the user with LoopBack, an open-source Node.js framework that uses a graphical user interface to create and manage custom databases.

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install -g strongloop
```
Scaffold out the files for your new app using:

```
$ slc loopback
```
Name your application and use the following options:

LoopBack version? 3.x (current)

What kind of application? api-server

You should be able to run your application using:

```
node .
```

Next, navigate to http://localhost:3000/explorer. You should see the LoopBack UI.

Example: Add a User

In the Loopback Explorer Click on User, and then click POST (/Users), then using the form in the UI add a new user as a JSON object in the value field:

```
{
  "realm": "example",
  "username": "mike",
  "email": "mike@example.com",
  "emailVerified": true
}
```

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
